How to use reactCardSlider extension

1. Drag the extension in your sheet
2. Choose 4 dimensions: 
   a. One that would be the title of the card → ClusterName 
   b. One that would be the image of the card → Image
   c. One that would be the url → Link
   d. One that would be the displayed name of the link → LinkName
3. In the dimension panel, expand every chosen dimension
4. On the bottom, you will find "Dimension type" dropdown, make the selection according to point 2.

If everything is fine the extension would render the card slider, else will display an error message.

In the other setting panels you can find all the personalizations.
